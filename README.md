## How to use it

1. **Add your API spec**: Paste your OpenAPI JSON or import a Postman collection
2. **Set up variables**: Add different values you want to test. There are two types:
   - **General variables**: Used automatically everywhere in your tests
   - **Local variables**: Set directly on specific tests and override the general values
3. **Find endpoints**: Search for the specific API paths you want to test
4. **Run tests**: The extension will test all your combinations automatically. You can configure:
   - **Delay between requests**: Set how long to wait between each test
   - **Worker numbers**: Control how many tests run at the same time
   - **Custom headers**: Add authorization tokens, cookies, or other headers
